## Question 1

1.) In R, write a function that will accept a character string representing a nucleic acid sequence and outputs
the corresponding mRNA strand. Note that the sequence may consist of both upper and lower case letters.

```{r}
DNA2mRNA <- function(s){gsub("T","U",toupper(s))}

DNA2mRNA("atcg")
```
