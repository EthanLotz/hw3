## Question 2

2.) In R, write a function that will accept a character string representing a nucleic acid sequence and outputs
the percent of bases that are either G or C (GC content). Note that the sequence may consist of both upper
and lower case letters.

```{r}
GCcontent <- function(s){
  s=toupper(s)
  a=str_count(s,"G")+str_count(s,"C")
  (a/nchar(s))*100
  }

GCcontent("atcg")
```
